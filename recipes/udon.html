        <h2>Savory Beef Udon with a Light Broth</h2>

        <p>
            This comforting bowl of beef udon brings together tender slices of marinated beef,
             thick chewy noodles, and a light, savory dashi-based broth that's both rich and delicate.
              It's a balanced dish — warming yet not too heavy — perfect for a cozy dinner or a soothing midday meal.
               The broth is infused with soy sauce, mirin, and a hint of sweetness to complement the umami of the beef,
                and the noodles soak up the flavors beautifully without overpowering them.

        <p>
            Topping the bowl is a soft-poached or gently simmered egg that breaks into the broth,
             adding a creamy depth, along with thinly sliced scallions for a touch of brightness.
              Optional garnishes like toasted sesame seeds or a sprinkle of shichimi togarashi
               (Japanese chili pepper mix) can elevate the dish even further.
                Whether you're craving something satisfying yet not too bold,
                 or you're looking to bring a bit of Japanese comfort food to your kitchen,
                  this beef udon delivers warmth, texture, and flavor in every bite.

            <li>Optional: toasted sesame seeds, shichimi togarashi (Japanese chili mix), nori strips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>1. Prepare the Broth</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, combine dashi, soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and sake (if using).</li>
            <li>Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Keep warm on low heat.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Cook the Beef</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a separate pan, heat a bit of sesame oil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the beef slices and cook briefly until they begin to brown.</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to the beef. Cook for 1 to 2 more minutes until the liquid slightly reduces and coats the beef.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Cook the Udon Noodles</h3>

        <ol>
            <l1>If using frozen udon, cook according to package directions (usually 1 to 2 minutes in boiling water).
                 If using fresh or dried noodles, cook until just tender.</l1>
            <l1>Drain and rinse lightly to remove excess starch. Divide into serving bowls.</l1>
        </ol>

        <h3>4. Prepare the Eggs</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Poached Method (Recommended):</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a small pot of water to a light simmer.</li>
                    <li>Crack each egg into a small bowl. Swirl the water gently and slide the egg in.</li>
                    <li>Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until whites are set but yolk is still soft. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Alternative Soft Boiled Method:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil eggs for 6 to 7 minutes, then transfer to an ice bath for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Peel carefully.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
         </ul>

        <h3>5. Assemble the Dish</h3>

         <ol>
            <li>Pour hot broth over the udon noodles in each bowl.</li>
            <li>Arrange the cooked beef on top.</li>
            <li>Gently place one egg on each bowl.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle sliced scallions over the top.</li>
            <li>Garnish with sesame seeds, a pinch of shichimi togarashi, or nori strips if desired.</li>
         </ol>

        <h4>Serving Tips</h4>
         <p>Serve immediately while hot. This dish pairs well with a side of pickled vegetables or
             a small bowl of steamed rice if you're especially hungry. If you're making this for a group,
              you can prep the broth and beef in advance and assemble just before serving.</p>
