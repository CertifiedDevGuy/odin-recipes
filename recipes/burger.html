        <h2>Spicy Crunch Burger with Cucumber, Jalapeño & Honey Mustard Heat</h2>

        <p>This bold and flavorful burger brings the heat and the crunch in every bite. Starting with a juicy,
             seared beef patty as the base, the burger is layered with thin slices of fresh cucumber for a cool, 
             crisp contrast, and fiery jalapeños to turn up the spice. The real star, though,
              is the spicy honey mustard sauce — a smooth blend of tangy Dijon mustard, sweet honey,
               and a kick of cayenne or chili flakes that ties it all together with a sweet-heat punch.
         </p>

        <p>
            Built on a toasted brioche bun, the combination of textures and flavors creates a balanced yet adventurous burger experience.
             The cucumbers mellow out the jalapeños just enough to keep things interesting without overpowering,
              while the sauce seeps into every layer, ensuring each bite delivers a perfect mix of savory, spicy, and sweet.
               Ideal for anyone who likes their burgers with a twist, this recipe is a fresh take on heat-meets-refreshment.

            <li>1 tablespoon butter (for toasting buns)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>For the Spicy Honey Mustard Sauce</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon apple cider vinegar (optional, for tang)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper or chili flakes (adjust to heat preference)</li>
            <li>Pinch of garlic powder</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <h4>1. Make the Sauce</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together Dijon mustard, honey, apple cider vinegar (if using),
                 cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Stir until smooth and well combined. Taste and adjust heat or sweetness as needed. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>2. Prep the Toppings</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Slice cucumber and jalapeño thinly. For less heat, remove jalapeño seeds and membranes.</li>
            <li>If using cheese, have it ready for melting at the end of cooking the patties.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>3. Cook the Patties</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Season the beef patties generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat.
                 Cook patties for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Add cheese slices in the last minute of cooking, if using, and cover to melt.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>4. Toast the Buns</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>While patties are cooking, melt butter in a pan and toast the brioche buns cut-side down until golden brown.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>5. Assemble the Burgers</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Spread a generous amount of the spicy honey mustard sauce on both the top and bottom bun.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked patty on the bottom bun.</li>
            <li>Top with cucumber slices and jalapeño rounds.</li>
            <li>Add extra sauce if desired, then place the top bun.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Serving Suggestions:</h3>

        <p>Serve with sweet potato fries, a cold lager, or a simple side salad to balance out the heat.
             These burgers are also great with a touch of pickled red onion or a sprinkle of fresh cilantro for an extra flavor pop.</p>
